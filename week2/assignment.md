# Assignment

1. Scaffold a New Feature/endpoint

Learning Goal:
Students experience AI-assisted boilerplate generation and scaffolding within the existing framework—no manual typing needed. 

2. Add Unit Tests (Test-Driven Development)

Learning Goal:
Demonstrates AI-enabled TDD workflows—Cursor can generate tests first, then code to satisfy them. 


3. Refactor Existing Code for Clarity

Learning Goal:
Shows AI’s ability to understand logic and perform intelligent code rewrites and cleanup without writing new code manually. 

4. Use Agentic Mode to Automate a Small Task

Learning Goal:
Students see how Cursor’s Agentic Mode can analyze, plan, generate, and integrate code across multiple files autonomously with minimal human prompts. 


5. Generate a README from the Codebase

Learning Goal:
Students learn how AI can introspect a codebase and produce documentation automatically, showcasing Cursor’s ability to parse code context and translate it into human‑readable form.
